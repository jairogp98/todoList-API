# TodoList-API
A basic to-do list RESTful API implemented with Python-Flask, SQLAlchemy and documented with Swagger.

Libraries used:

flask

black

flask_restx

flask_sqlalchemy

dotenv

psycopg2

bcrypt

Flask-Migrate

You could install these from the requirements.txt with pip. I implemented it with Python 3.9.6

You have to authenticate yourself with /auth/ and it will give you a JWT token so you can use the entire API without problem.
